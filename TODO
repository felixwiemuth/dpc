Dynamic Invariants:
  ✔ Dynamic invariant assertion in the simulator (in bool) @done (18-03-13 20:30)

Code Generation:
  ✔ Basic notion of codegeneration in place @done (18-03-13 20:23)
  ☐ Build a pure runner that also advances the protocol    @started(18-03-14 16:57)
  ☐ Build an IO runner that actually races threads
  ☐ Try simple case studies for implementation once a runner is in place
  ☐ From Protlet to Code stubs:
    ☐ Encapsulate blocking receive via tail-recursive loop
      Presumably when in the `Running` protocol state
    ☐ Running Example: two calculators in one protocol (addition and multiplication) and computing polynomials

Protlet Constructor:
  Wait for the response from N>1 nodes of a certain kind (multi/broadcast --> Receive from qurom)
  ✔ Two-phase Commit @done (18-03-13 20:29)
  ☐ Single Decree Paxos

Two Phase Commit:
  ✔ Basic implementation of invariant @done (18-03-13 17:21)
  ☐ Include the notion of round in the protocol + invariant
  ☐ Do a basic implementation using the code generation
